# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This folder includes notebooks that explore the SpaceX launch dataset using:
- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization (matplotlib and seaborn)
- SQL queries for structured data exploration

The objective is to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between launch success and key variables such as payload mass, orbit type, and launch site.
