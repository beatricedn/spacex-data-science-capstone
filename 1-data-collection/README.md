# Data Collection

This folder contains notebooks used to collect SpaceX launch data from multiple sources.

Data was gathered using:
- SpaceX REST API (JSON responses)
- Web scraping of Wikipedia launch tables (HTML parsing)
- Provided CSV datasets from the course resources

The goal of this stage was to retrieve raw launch data and metadata required for further analysis.
