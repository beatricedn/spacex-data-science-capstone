# Predictive Analysis

This folder contains notebooks implementing classification models to predict first-stage landing success.

Models include:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Hyperparameters were optimized using GridSearchCV, and models were evaluated using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.
